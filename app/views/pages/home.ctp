<p>Come and take a look around, try one of the headings above to get started.</p>

<p>A site will be here soon that will aid collaboration between students using live lecture note sessions saved for future revision. You'll be able to find such sessions by organization, location or via people you know also using the site.</p>  

<p>This site represents the output of a final-year project by George Nixon of Cardiff University, begun October 2011. All rights reserved... for now. The source code will be open-sourced in summer 2012, but for pesky university reasons viz. collaboration, or in their parlance, plagiarism, it'll be off-limits until then. Suggestions welcome, however.</p>
